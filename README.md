# 🛠️ MDB-USB-adapter

**MDB-USB-adapter** is a hardware and software adapter project designed to work with devices using the **Multi-Drop Bus (MDB)** protocol. The adapter converts MDB data into a USB interface, allowing vending equipment (coin acceptors, bill validators, etc.) to be connected to a computer for analysis, emulation, and debugging.

## 🧩 Key Components
- **Hardware**: A USB-MDB converter schematic designed in EasyEDA.
- **Software**: Firmware for a microcontroller that processes the 9-bit MDB data format (8 data bits + 1 mode bit).
- Documentation and usage examples for quick setup.

## 🚀 Features
- **🔌 MDB Protocol Support**: The adapter is compatible with devices using the MDB standard, making it useful for working with vending systems.
- **🎮 Device Emulation**: The adapter can be used to emulate MDB peripheral devices, such as bill validators or coin acceptors.
- **📊 Data Analysis**: Enables "sniffing" of the MDB bus to analyze data transmitted between devices.
- **💻 PC Integration**: Connects MDB devices to a computer via USB for further data processing.

## 👥 Who is this project for?
- **👨‍💻 Engineers and developers** working with vending equipment.
- **🔧 Enthusiasts** interested in reverse engineering and communication protocols.
- **🎓 Students and researchers** studying hardware and software solutions.
